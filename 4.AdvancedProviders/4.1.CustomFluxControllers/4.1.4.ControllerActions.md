4.1.4 Controller actions
========================

Your template files inside for example the `Content` subfolder are - according to Extbase conventions - connected directly to a
Controller's action. In standard Extbase, the Controller action must exist first and will then cause the template file to be
rendered - in Fluid Powered TYPO3 this is reversed (since your Controller is optional): *the template file should first and
foremost exist and if a Controller and Controller action can be resolved which match the template, it will then be used*. This is
the reason why even when your Controller class contains no action methods, it will still be able to render the template file (and
internally in Flux, this is because a fallback action - `renderAction()` - exists on the AbstractFluxController class).

If for example you have a template file in `EXT:myext/Resources/Private/Templates/Content/MyElement.html` the corresponding
Controller action would be named `myElementAction` (note the required `Action` suffix; without it your action will not be seen).
Inside your controller action you can then perform operations which for example are very complex in Fluid or require access to
request parameters, session variables and such.

```php
public function myElementAction() {
	$special = $this->doSomethingSpecialTo($this->settings['someValue']);
    $this->view->assign('mySpecialVariable', $special);
}
```

Now, whenever your `MyElement.html` template gets rendered (by `fluidcontent` in this case) your special Controller class will be
created and the action called, causing your special code to execute and the `{mySpecialVariable}` Fluid variable to be assigned.
