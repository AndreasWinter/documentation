4.2.1 Use cases for custom Providers
====================================

![FluidTYPO3 File contexts, Providers](../Images/FileContext/Providers.svgz)

A Provider is a class which:

1. Is always associated with one database table, fx `tt_content` or `pages` or your custom tables.
2. Is resolved through Flux whenever a record from that table is edited, moved, saved, deleted, rendered etc.
3. Triggers (as in: processes records from the table it connects with) only under certain circumstances, for example when a
   `tt_content` record has a `list_type` that matches a particular plugin.
4. Contains a number of methods to get information based on one row from the table the Provider is connected with.
5. Contains a number of methods to manipulate records from the DB table it connects with.
6. Is used by your [Flux-enabled controller] when it are rendered through frontend plugins to fetch important rendering-related
   information like which controller to use, which template file, the paths for the View object, etc.

## Illustration of purpose

For example, the `fluidcontent` Provider - named `ContentProvider` - connects with the `tt_content` table and is triggered only
when the `CType` value of the record matches `fluidcontent_content` (which is the plugin signature name for `fluidcontent`).
This Provider gets used in the backend to resolve a `FluidTYPO3\Flux\Form` instance based on which specific `fluidcontent`
element you select. It reads values which were stored in the record by filling and saving the Flux form. It reacts to cache
clearing (by refreshing the stored definitions of available `fluidcontent` templates) and finally, it is integrated in the
`ContentController` from `fluidcontent` which renders each element - here, in the controller, it is used to return variables,
template paths, desired controller name and controller extension name, and so on.

Flux then uses these variables and settings to route the request to the proper controller based on extension name etc.
(`fluidcontent` uses this to make it possible to add your own `ContentControllers` in other extensions). Since your `fluidcontent`
element is identified by a combination of extension key and template name, this Provider can then (by getting extension key based
on this value, for example `fluidcontent_bootstrap:Alert.html`) detect a class name of a controller to which Flux should
delegate rendering).

Other Providers may choose completely different ways of enabling for example a dynamic template filename which changes based on
the record's type or some other way of discriminating types of records from the same table, but this example should illustrate the
essense of what Providers are meant to do (without overloading you completely, because there is of course much more it can do).

## Connecting frontend and backend

Provider classes are meant to be the connection between backend and frontend - but you can also use them exclusively in the
backend or frontend as you like. The main benefit comes when you also use a [Flux-enabled controller] in an Extbase plugin - when
you do this, the Provider acts as the link between your records and the template file, paths, variables and so on that your
controller should use when rendering each record.

All in all this makes the Provider _the_ place to return dynamic returns for template, paths, rendering variables. Since the
Provider gets used in both frontend and backend, the return values will be consistent in both places.

## Test friendly

Along with the better _separation of concern_ a Provider is also easy to write unit tests for. And, since it works the same way in
both frontend and backend, ensuring that it connects properly in one context also means it connects properly in others. Since it
mainly delegates to Services and other classes, it becomes easy to mock those so-called "fan-outs" in tests. Finally, it removes
some of the usually necessary code from controller classes into more a separate, much more test friendly context. As a bonus, Flux
provides a base unit test class which when used, should immediately cover a lot of the custom methods you choose to add. This class
is called `FluidTYPO3\Flux\Tests\Unit\Provider\AbstractProviderTestCase` and can be easily subclassed in your own unit test.
