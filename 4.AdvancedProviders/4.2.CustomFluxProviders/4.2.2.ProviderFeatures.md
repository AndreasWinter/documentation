4.2.3 Provider features
=======================

![FluidTYPO3 File contexts, Providers](../Images/FileContext/Providers.svgz)

The Provider class features all revolve around class methods which you can override as needed. These methods can be divided up
into four specific groups of methods with similar responsibilities:


| Integration           | Templates                       | Records                      | Components         |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------ |
| trigger()             | getTemplatePathAndFilename()    | preProcessRecord()           | getForm()          |
| getExtensionKey()     | setTemplatePathAndFilename()    | postProcessRecord()          | setForm()          |
| getTableName()        | getTemplateVariables()          | postProcessDataStructure()   | getGrid()          |
| setTableName()        | getTemplateVariables()          | preProcessCommand()          | setGrid()          |
| getFieldName()        | getConfigurationSectionName()   | postProcessCommand()         | getPreview()       |
| setFieldName()        | setConfigurationSectionName()   | clearCacheCommand()          |                    |
| getPriority()         |                                 | getFlexFormValues()          |                    |
|                       |                                 | getInheritanceTree()         |                    |

Common for many of these methods is that _they accept a record as argument_. This allows you to first analyse the record in your
method before manipulating it or returning values based on it. For example, `fluidcontent` uses this behavior to return different
template paths for different values in the _Fluid content type_ field. Another way to utilise this could for example be to match
the record type as configured by TCA, before returning a `Form` component instance - allowing you to return a different `Form` for
each type your record can have.

## Areas of responsibility

The methods in the **Integration** column are used by TYPO3 when detecting Providers and asking your Provider whether or not it
should process the current record (in frontend or backend). The getters and setters in this category retrieve and configure the
matching conditions - which table, field and priority your Provider has - and the `trigger()` method is implemented in the base
class as a simple method to get the table name and field name and analyse the record passed as argument to see if it matches.

The **Templates** group of methods are all concerned with resolving template filenames, getting a set of predefined variables,
returning the name of the `Configuration` section. If for example your template file contains multiple Configuration sections,
the `getConfigurationSectionName` method receives a record as argument which means you can change the section name based on one
or more properties of the record.

The **Records** group deals specifically with processing records (and commands executed on records, like copy or delete). These
methods can be overridden to make your Provider perform custom operations for example before and after your record is saved. Note
that the `postProcessDataStructure` is a low-level part of the Provider - normally you should not need to override this particular
method since what it does, is convert your `Form` instance to a `TCEforms` array. The only use case for overriding this field, is
to manually return the `TCEforms` array and/or perform manual modifications to an existing data structure (including ones which
were generated by other Providers). In almost all cases the right one to override to affect the `Form`, is the `getForm` method.

The final group **Components** deals directly with returning instances of `Form` and `Grid` classes, and preview content (which
currently only applies to records from the TYPO3 content element table, `tt_content`). In implementations which store these types
of configuration in template files, these methods try to read this data from templates - but a custom Provider is free to return
these instances directly. If for example your Provider returns both a `Form` and `Grid` instance, your template files no longer
are required to contain a `flux:form` tag or `f:section` named `Configuration`. Indeed, your Provider no longer needs to return a
template filename if it returns these instances directly (if your Provider is used in a Flux-enabled controller, not returning a
template filename simply causes the controller to attempt to render the template file that is associated with the current action).

## Loading/detecting Providers

Providers are always used in one of two possible ways:

1. Detection using a record, table name, field name and priority
2. Manually creating instances (and if necessary, setting their table and field name)

The Providers you find in for example `flux` and `fluidcontent` are registered using Flux's Core class - which means they can be
detected automatically when Flux detects a record being saved, moved and so on. These Providers are registered with a default
priority which means that any Provider you yourself register with a higher priority, will be used instead of the existing one.

Using `NULL` as value of any of the matching properties (`tableName`, `fieldName`, `contentObjectType` etc) means your Provider
is a general, _but lower priority_ match for records from the associated DB table. And that means, if another Provider class has a
more specific match (for example, if it uses a matching `fieldName` that is not NULL) then it gets resolved first and your
Provider get resolved after it.

Some areas of Flux are able to ask multiple Providers for components - which means for example when getting a `TCEforms` structure
this structure may be processed by multiple Providers - so be careful when you register multiple Providers for the same field. In
some cases it is preferable to first unregister the old Provider class name before registering your own. Unregistering a Provider
happens by class name and both removes and prevents the unregistered class name from being used.

A Flux-enabled controller can also choose to create the Provider only when rendering in the frontend. Doing this means you can use
all the template related features (including the data transformation feature which is configured through the `Form` instance), but
naturally none of the backend-related features. The standard approach is to simply register your Provider to be used along with
your plugin's `list_type`.

> Small note about Providers attached to the `tt_content` table: since it is likely that multiple Providers will already be used
> with this table, it is best practice to **check for the proper `list_type` or `CType` value of the record before you let your
> Provider class perform operations on records**. Doing this will avoid having your Provider's code called unintentionally.
