1.3 Template file usage
=======================

![FluidTYPO3 File contexts, templates](../Images/FileContext/Templates.svgz)

It should be pretty clear just from this that we _use Extbase's conventions to place configuration and template folders and files_
and that _your provider extension is simply a standard TYPO3 extension with some predefined file structure_. The way you use each
folder normally depends on which type of Provider Extension you are creating - and the feature-specific guides always start by
explaining which folders and files are involved.

Your `ext_localconf.php` and `ext_tables.php` files will contain the various calls to Flux to register which types of Flux
templates your Provider Extension uses - along with any other configuration you might need; custom TCA fields for `tt_content` fx.
The `Resources/Private` folder contains a template structure and the language file - and the templates are divided into subfolders
by name of the controller which will render them (e.g. in `fluidpages` the controller is named `PageController` which means the
folder name is `Page`, in `fluidcontent` the controller name is `Content` and so on). Layouts and Partials are supported just like
normal. And finally, the `Configuration` directory contains the TypoScript that your extension makes available for integrators to
select and use in TYPO3 when your Provider Extension is installed.

### What must the template files contain?

The actual contents of template files depends on which feature they should be used with - but there are a few shared rules which
you can read all about in the [Templates concept](../3.Templating/3.2.CreatingTemplateFiles/3.2.1.CommonFileStructure.md) chapter
of this documentation. Following the standard rules always results in a working, selectable (yet very minimal) template - what the
template should contain in addition to the standard format is up to each specific feature and is documented by each feature.

The only files which are required to contain the standard format, are the files located under `Templates` - in other words: your
Layouts and Partials can contain any content you want, but Templates must contain Flux-specific information.

### How is a Flux template different from plain Fluid?

A template file which can be used by Flux is exactly the same as a normal fluid template - but with some added requirements:

1. The namespace `{namespace flux=FluidTYPO3\Flux\ViewHelpers}` must be present.
2. There must be a `Configuration` section created using `f:section`.

Inside the `Configuration` section (or whichever name you chose, in case you chose not to follow conventions) you should place
a `flux:form` tag containing at least an `id` attribute which should have a `lowerCamelCase` value, for example `specialImage`.

There is an optional section you can add when your Flux template is going to be used with the `tt_content` table - the section
called `Preview` (again, added using `f:section`) can contain HTML output that is displayed in the page module in TYPO3 when you
view that particular record. This works automatically for Flux-enabled plugins (which includes but is not limited to elements
for use in `fluidcontent`).

The final convention - which you *should* follow for transparency but which *can* be ignored when necessary, is to name the
section which contains the actual output rendering for the frontend, `Main` - this section gets rendered from the Layout you use,
which means you can of course choose a different name if that makes sense. Using the name `Main` simply means other people will
immediately know the purpose of that section.

An extremely minimal template example (example: `fluidcontent` element template):

```xml
{namespace flux=FluidTYPO3\Flux\ViewHelpers}
<f:layout name="Content" />
<f:section name="Configuration">
    <flux:form id="myContentElement" />
</f:section>
<f:section name="Main">
    My content element
</f:section>
```

As you can see, this minimal example fulfills only the two main requirements above and uses name conventions for the Layout which
we describe in the next chapter. If added to a `fluidcontent` template collection, this template would result in one new content
element type named "myContentElement" which has no extra form fields, no special icon, no human-readable label and when rendered,
displays a simple "My content element" text without any HTML container element.

### Alternative to templates

Note that there is an alternative to placing your form and fields inside the template. When you use a custom Provider class you
can have this class return PHP objects directly from the `getForm` and `getGrid` methods. Your Provider will have inherited those
two methods from Flux's `AbstractProvider` class - and in the code inherited from Flux, your Provider will by default look into
the template file for a Form and Grid instance. When you override either of these methods, reading the Form and Grid respectively,
does not have to require reading a template file.

What this means is that if you return native PHP objects from a Provider for both the Form *and* Grid instances, your template
file itself no longer is required to contain a `Configuration` section and any `flux:form` definition. Your Provider can even
return a raw HTML preview - which when done, lets you skip the `Preview` section as well. Of course, Previews only apply to
`tt_content` records as already mentioned.

> Careful! Some features from Fluid Powered TYPO3 will require template files containing a `Configuration` section and a
> `flux:form` tag. While it is possible to get around even this requirement, it involves creating a custom Provider to take the
> place of a Provider included with the extension, e.g. `fluidcontent` ContentProvider, `fluidpages` PageProvider, and so on.
> By replacing Providers you can change almost all aspects of how a certain feature works, fitting it to your site in exactly the
> right way. We designed the API so that features like `fluidcontent` all have the exact same level of API access that your own
> Providers do, which means anything these extensions can do yours can, too.
