1.6 Fluid best practices
========================

Tasks:

1. Template file naming conventions
2. Limiting the amount of very big template chunks, fx. multiple very big `f:if` statements
3. Using Partials efficiently - including Sections in Partials. Inform of possibility to place Flux form components in Partials.
4. Using Layouts efficiently - using multiple Layouts for Content, Page, CoreContent etc., describe usage of dynamic Layout names.
5. Limiting number of assigned variables fx. those set in TS (array copy, debug clarity, duplication risks etc.)
6. Using overlays (natively supported in `fluidpages` and `fluidcontent`, mention/link `EXT:view` and `templateRootPath**s**` in 6.2.
7. Making sure templates are compilable - avoiding uncompilable ViewHelpers on high-traffic pages / uncached plugins. `EXT:builder`.
8. Recognising when to create a custom ViewHelper to perform complex operations.
