1.4 Configuration usage
=======================

![FluidTYPO3 File contexts, Configuration](../Images/FileContext/Configuration.svgz)

Tasks:

1. How `fluidcontent` and others use TypoScript settings
3. How they use PHP configuration (registration commands, Providers defined ad-hoc using the Flux Core class)


### View path definitions in TypoScript

Flux will automatically look in the default template paths - even if you don't add any configuration - but you can (and indeed you
should) add your View configuration as TypoScript. You do this the same way you do it for any Extbase/Fluid extension so we won't
cover that here.

Provider extensions, like any Extbase extension, have template paths setup in `plugin.tx_yourextwithoutunderscores.view`.

Changing the view paths in TypoScript affects Flux just like it would affect any other extension. Flux will look in the new path
instead of the old one. Here it is worth noting that you can use so-called template path "overlays" - you can read more about how
these are set up, in [the documentation for EXT:view about path overlays](https://github.com/FluidTYPO3/view#template-path-overlays).
The same procedure is supported by `fluidcontent`, `fluidpages` etc. - and indeed, any extension in which you use Flux gets this
support without the need to install EXT:view. To get overlay capabilities for non-Flux extensions, simply install EXT:view and
follow the same procedure.
