1.6 Portable code
=================

Tasks:

1. Packaging extensions, setting dependencies properly.
2. TypoScript concerns: sane default constants, avoiding `ext_typoscript_setup.txt`.
3. Namespaces and oldschool class names - ClassAliasMap, gotchas regarding some core/third-party features requiring old names.
4. Avoiding deprecated ViewHelpers (note: feature for `EXT:schemaker` to check for and warn on detecting @deprecated annotations is planned but not currently ready)
