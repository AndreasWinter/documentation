3.2.3 Creating Content Elements
===============================

Content elements are defined similar to page templates and consist of a layout and a template file. Typically the layout simply renders the main section of the template and is shared with several content elements:

```xml
<f:layout name="Content" />

<f:render section="Main" />
```

All magic happens in the content element's template file which in its basic structure looks like this:

```xml
<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" lang="en"
      xmlns:f="http://typo3.org/ns/fluid/ViewHelpers"
      xmlns:flux="http://typo3.org/ns/FluidTYPO3/Flux/ViewHelpers"
      xmlns:v="http://typo3.org/ns/FluidTYPO3/Vhs/ViewHelpers">

<f:layout name="Content" />

<f:section name="Configuration" />

<f:section name="Preview" />

<f:section name="Main" />

</div>
```

As you can see we connect the template to the above layout via ``<f:layout name="Content" />``, add a section named ``Configuration`` that will contain our flexform, a Section named ``Preview`` that will get rendered in the backend and the ``Main`` section as found in the layout that will contain the rendered frontend content.

Now, let's create a content element for a typical use case: a teaserbox consisting of an image, a headline, some teaser text and an optional link in ``typo3conf/ext/myextensionkey/Resources/Private/Templates/Content/Teaser.html``:

```xml
<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" lang="en"
      xmlns:f="http://typo3.org/ns/fluid/ViewHelpers"
      xmlns:flux="http://typo3.org/ns/FluidTYPO3/Flux/ViewHelpers"
      xmlns:v="http://typo3.org/ns/FluidTYPO3/Vhs/ViewHelpers">

<f:layout name="Content"/>

<f:section name="Configuration">
    <flux:form id="teaser">
        <flux:field.file name="image" allowed="jpg" uploadFolder="uploads/tx_quickstart" minItems="1" maxItems="1" size="1" />
        <flux:field.input name="headline" />
        <flux:field.text name="teasertext" rows="5" cols="30" required="TRUE" />
        <flux:field.input name="link">
            <flux:wizard.link activeTab="page"/>
        </flux:field.input>
    </flux:form>
</f:section>

<f:section name="Preview">
	<table width="100%">
	    <tr>
	        <td width="50%"><v:media.image src="uploads/tx_quickstart/{image}" alt="{headline}" width="100" /></td>
	        <td width="50%">
	            <f:format.crop maxCharacters="50">{teasertext}</f:format.crop>
	            <f:if condition="{link}">
	                <strong>Link:</strong> {link}
	            </f:if>
	        </td>
	    </tr>
	</table>
</f:section>

<f:section name="Main">
	<div class="quickstart-teaser">
	    <article>
	    <h1>{headline}</h1>
	    <div class="image-wrapper">
	        <v:media.image src="uploads/tx_quickstart/{image}" alt="{headline}" width="200" />
	    </div>
	    <div class="text-wrapper">
	        <f:format.nl2br>{teasertext}</f:format.nl2br>
	        <f:if condition="{link}">
	            <f:link.page pageUid="{link}" title="{headline}" class="readmore">read more</f:link.page>
	        </f:if>
	    </div>
	    </article>
	</div>
</f:section>

</div>
```

## Let's have a look at the three sections:

``Configuration`` contains the flexform that defines the content element's fields which are wrapped in an outer ``<flux:form />`` viewhelper. ``id`` is a required argument for this viewhelper and used to generate the translation key for the element's label (flux.teaser in this case) in TYPO3's _New Content Element Wizard_. By default a new tab labelled _FCE_ is created which can be overridden with the viewhelper argument ``wizardTab``.

There's nothing special about the flexform's fields in this example so to avoid duplicate content please take a look at the reference guide on [fluidtypo3.org](http://fluidtypo3.org/viewhelpers/flux.html) where you can find all required information about their functionality and arguments. One thing to take a closer look at though is the link wizard that is implemented by making it a child of the according input field.

> The fields' values are accessible as equally named variables in sections ``Preview`` and ``Main``.

``Preview`` contains some real oldschool table layout to be rendered in the backend and which may look familiar if you worked with Templavoil√† before. Note the usage of ``<v:media.image />`` to avoid issues with displaying images in the backend due to relative paths.

``Main`` finally contains the output to be rendered in the frontend and makes use of some fluid viewhelpers you certainly know already.

After clearing caches you should now see a new tab _FCE_ in the _New Content Element Wizard_ that makes our new content element selectable.
