FluidTYPO3: Developer Resources
===============================

This section contains resources for developers. The chapters are divided into:

* [Our values regarding code quality and style](../6.DeveloperResources/6.1.CodeValues.md)
* [A comprehensive contribution guide](../6.DeveloperResources/6.2.Contributing.md)
* [A description of the continuous integration setup](../6.DeveloperResources/6.3.ContinuousIntegration.md)

Contributors should familiarise themselves with the quality/style values and contribution guide chapters. Knowledge of the continuous integration setup is not required for standard contributions.
