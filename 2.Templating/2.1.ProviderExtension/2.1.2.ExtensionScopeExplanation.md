2. Explanation of purposes of `Public` and `Private` type resources; include info of `f:uri.resource` and others using `Public` as base path.
3. Conventions for placing template files: note about controller name influence in relation to `Page`, `Content` subfolders.
4. Explanation of where to place any custom Controllers and ViewHelpers and how to include a static TypoScript file.
5. Extbase's separation of for example framework-specific settings like `defaultPid` on `plugin.tx_myext.view.defaultPid` as it gets used in files.
